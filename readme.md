# wishsort
web based thingy to sort steam wishlist hopefully


log into steam | no need to login  -> steam id should be enough
get wishlist
make user pick a million things via steam game widget iframes and ehhh some overlay button on hover to pick and a progress bar thingy, store list in localstorage or smth alongside steamusername
if possible sort the final list via steam api (this WOULD require login in some way 100%)
